# chatbot-project
This project demonstrates the development of a rule-based chatbot enhanced by machine learning techniques using Python, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), and Keras. The chatbot can classify user inputs into predefined intents and provide appropriate responses. A Tkinter GUI interface allows end-users to chat interactively with the model.
